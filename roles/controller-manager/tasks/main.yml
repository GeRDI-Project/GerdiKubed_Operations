# Description:
# The controller-manager runs on all master instances and distributes the
# deployments and pods to the kubelets running on the node instances.
# You can choose to run the controller-manager as a systemd-service
# (set CONTROLER_MANAGER_AS_SERVICE to "True") or as a pod
# (CONTROLER_MANAGER_AS_POD to "True"). At least and at most one of these options has to be true.
