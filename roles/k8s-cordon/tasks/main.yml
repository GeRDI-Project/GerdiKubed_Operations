# Description:
# This role makes sure that the kubernetes master and loadbalancer are excluded from having pods scheduled upon them.
#
# This is dirty, but necessary.
# Wait for the kube-dns and kube-addon-manager to enter running state
# Otherwise the cordon node will force it to be stuck in pending state
- name: k8s-cordon master | Wait for start of k8s-addons
  shell: kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep -c "Running"
  register: result
  until: result.stdout.find("2") != -1
  retries: 10
  delay: 5
  when: inventory_hostname in groups['kubernetes-masters']

- name: k8s-cordon master & loadbalancer | Cordon node, if master or loadbalancer
  shell: kubectl cordon {{ inventory_hostname }}
  when: inventory_hostname in groups['kubernetes-masters'] + groups['loadbalancer-nodes']
  environment:
    KUBECONFIG: '{{ K8S_KUBECONFIG }}'
